Summer Internship Projects with Codesoft

During my summer internship with Codesoft, I had the opportunity to work on five projects using Python, each aimed at improving my programming skills and understanding of software development. 

The projects include: 

To-Do List: A simple task management application to keep track of daily activities.

Calculator: A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations.

Password Generator: A tool that generates secure and random passwords.

Rock-Paper-Scissors: A  game simulating the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

Contact Book: An application for managing contacts, including phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses.

These projects helped me gain hands-on experience with Python programming, problem-solving, and building user-friendly applications.
